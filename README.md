Gradient-Flows
==============

Notes I made as an undergraduate for the course on gradient flows in metric spaces. They are not so good, but I intend to improve on them somewhere in the future. For now, I have only updated the LaTeX 
slightly to make it run smoother as I have learnt quite a bit in the meanwhile.
